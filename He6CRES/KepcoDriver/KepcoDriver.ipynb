    "* I am using a 2 ohm resistor for testing purposes. \n",
    "* I need to code in a safety mechanism to not let the supply get to a dangerously high voltage/current.\n",
    "* I should look into the message bounce. Now (2/4/20) it doesn't seem to be doing it so my code is breaking.\n",
    "* BIG: IF the outp function goes off the supply will look like it works but then display and output nothing. Learned this the hard way. Maybe when an instance of Kepco bop is made I should \"*rst\" and then \"OUTP ON\". To make sure it's good to go. \n",
    "* 2/10/20: Get the mode thing to work, weird that you have to set a voltage first but seems to be working now as I want it. Get it to work on the current side of things and then get the flipping to work. Also getVOLT gets what the voltage has been set to but not what it truly is. How do I get what it actually is? "
